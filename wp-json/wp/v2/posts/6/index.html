It wasn\u2019t the delivery which dismissed Iyer that stood out but the set-up. Iyer had to face Malik who was bowling thunderbolts on his arrival to the crease. The seed of a short ball doubt was put into his mind with the field and the balls before the dismissal. Iyer, rattled by the pace, just kept moving around the crease trying to find a solution and was eventually put out of his misery by the sheer pace of Malik.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On his day, with the right kind of backing, he can be lethal. Sunrisers Hyderabad didn\u2019t use him properly for whatever reasons, but that doesn\u2019t mean he should be in the ignored bin for too long. He has pace, he is young, and he needs a good captain and coach to use him effectively. The dismissal of Iyer in the IPL game displayed the right-arm quick has also got the smarts to set up a batter which might be useful in Test matches whilst bowling longer spells. He might be raw, but with good guidance and handling, he can deliver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the recent WTC debacle, Indian selectors are looking to blood a few fresh faces and the tour of the West Indies will be a perfect opportunity for Umran Malik to showcase his skills with the red ball<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the absence of Jasprit Bumrah in the final India went with 35-year-old\u00a0Umesh Yadav\u00a0who was supposed to be the X-factor in the side with his extra pace. However, things did not go according to the plan for Rohit\u2019s men on Day-1 which essentially cost the side the game. With age not on Umesh\u2019s side and the next WTC final once again in England at Lords in conditions where spinners will probably not have a lot to say, India need to build another pace battery unit and the tour to the Caribbean will be the ideal start for Malik\u2019s red ball career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pace bowler from\u00a0Jammu\u00a0and Kashmir played only a handful of seven first-class games in which he picked up 12 wickets at an economy of 4.46. However, the sample size is too small and he has shown the ability to hit hard lengths regularly in the IPL. In addition to overseas conditions, Malik will be a force to reckon with even in India with his extra pace, especially with the old ball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unknowns with him are obvious: does he have the ability to build spells, bowl 20 overs a day. Given the quality of West Indies batters in recent times this might be the ideal opportunity for Malik to learn on the job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mukesh Kumar-The reliable one<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>India got undone in the final by Scott Boland whose biggest strength is his discipline with the line and length, and how he weaves in the subtle variations which was key in taking down\u00a0Virat Kohli. After\u00a0Ishant Sharma\u00a0(in his final phase when India used him as a stock bowler), India are lacking someone who can hit one spot consistently for the entire day and bowl long spells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bengal\u2019s Mukesh Kumar is the ideal candidate for the role. He has been piling wickets in first-class cricket for the last few seasons. He picked up 123 wickets from just 33 games at an average of 21.49. He also has been in the reserves of the WTC squad. His ability to bowl long spells and keep things tight from his end irrespective of the conditions might allow the other quickmen to take a breather and keep the batsmen honest. In overseas Tests, India has struggled to dry the run flow when partnerships built up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arshdeep Singh- better investment than Unadkat?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since\u00a0Zaheer Khan\u00a0the men in blue have also been lacking in quality left-arm-seamer. Though Jaydev Unadkat has been carried along the squad in the last few series, the management seems to see him as more of a horses for courses option rather than a regular in the team. Arshdeep, who has been plying his trade in county cricket for Kent might be the suitable option for that role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to Malik, Arshdeep too has limited experience in first class cricket. He played seven games and picked up 21 wickets with an average of 35.19. However, he has shown in the past his ability to swing the new white ball and his stint at Kent will give him exposure to bowling in overseas conditions and bowling with the Dukes ball.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 2022 IPL Kolkata Knight Riders skipper Shreyas Iyer was undone by Umran Malik\u2019s fine yorker.
